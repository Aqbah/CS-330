# CS-330 Final Project

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software as a balance of creativity and structure. I begin by analyzing the problem, then breaking the project down into modular components. This helps me maintain clarity and scalability throughout development. I also refine my design through continuous iteration and feedback.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me develop a strong understanding of material system architecture, allowing me to create reusable templates for common materials like leather, glass, and plastic. I also learned how to manage scene complexity through resource budgeting and implemented viewport scaling to preserve aspect ratios dynamically.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
I began by blueprinting a class hierarchy, focusing on modularity and separation of concerns. I divided the scene into subsystems for geometry, lighting, and textures, and structured the design to prioritize the driver's view for a more immersive experience. This helped me maintain both performance and visual fidelity.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modular and resource-aware design strategies I used will be valuable in future work, especially in mobile and VR development, where optimization is key. The ability to abstract complex systems into manageable components will also help me scale up to larger or more collaborative projects.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development as an iterative learning process. I start simple and gradually layer on complexity, using version control and user feedback to guide improvements. I prefer to test frequently and refine based on performance and usability.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I adopted a shader-driven workflow to control material behavior via uniforms instead of hardcoding values. I also used snapshot versioning, creating weekly branches to safely iterate and test changes without risking the stability of the main project.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a core part of the process. I revised my UV mappings multiple times to fix texture stretching, refined camera controls based on testing, and reduced draw calls by batching materials. These iterations directly improved both usability and performance.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At the start, my focus was on getting basic shapes and rendering to work. As I progressed, I shifted to refining user interaction and optimizing performance. By the final milestone, I was thinking more like a system designer than just a coder, aligning form and function through code.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me the tools to turn ideas into tangible applications. Whether it’s through building simulations, visualizations, or interactive environments, it enables me to solve real-world problems creatively and efficiently.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This project deepened my understanding of matrices, shaders, and lighting models—all of which are foundational for advanced graphics topics. It also prepared me to explore algorithm visualizations and simulations in other STEM fields, like physics or biology.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics taught me how to translate technical concepts into visual experiences, a skill valuable in industries like automotive design, game development, and architecture. It also trained me to think spatially, optimize systems, and build with the user’s perspective in mind.
